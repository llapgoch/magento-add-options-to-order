- This will add arbitrary options which have been submitted with the product and put them on the line items in the quote and order screens.
- This will not translate the option on the order success page, or previous orders that will need to be done manually in sales/order/items/renderer/default.phtml.
- Options will not be carried through to reorders, this needs doing.
- There is currently no way to select which options to copy, this needs adding to the store config. Currently, only 'test_option' is looked for.
